So this is the first edit. So yeah this is some of the few things which I've thougth of making and actualy getting it into reality. 
I'm quite happy about this because I can share whatever I want and just put it up here.
I will share and preserve every possbile moment and thoughts with in me here so that I can com back and see where and all I've been through and where Ive reached now.
I will share about my family about my work and everything my life revolve areound and the most important being the thoughts in my mind which kind of create a whirlpool inside me in and out sometimes. Well expressing it in one form or another I think it weill be helpfull for me to do so.
I will write about how I percieve the world and how I believe to solve the problems of the world. I will seriously talke in accounts of some TV shows like MR ROBOT, haikyuu and other to make the if not ideal a good place to leave on for everyone in there own place and stand which is on the ground.
