So yeah I just created a new hugo second document using the terminal and it was quite satifying at the same time hastle free as I didnt had to type the time :).

So what for today...
    1. Just had a walk with Vijesh aapan and kind of had a little run over the new bypass. It was quite refreshing. There I was thinking how problems related to my father were going to go away and more importantly I was thinking whether it was worth it to go to abhishek and go all the way from here to his home insted of going to my father mothers home where she was laying ill for some time. Or should I just sit here and work on myself. Because the last time when I went to drop off abhishek I kind of made an deal with myself that I will stick to my plan and dont spend any time from then onwards other than myself.
    But now 
        > I feel kind of want to go there but why please tell me why do you want to go just enjoy yourself. 
         
        > havent you enjoyed yourself till this age and just think right arent you enjoying right now yeah you are the only thing which you have to do is 
        > learn the things which you allways want to and uplift you. 
         
        * if you want to go I'm not going to stop even I want to go there and meet all those people then what ....huh then what is it going to benifit you in any way.
   
   
   
    So what should you do to help your only friend who stood by yourself all this time. Or just do whatever the hell thing you want to do. This thing may eat you today but just you have to keep in mind why you are doing this and where you really want to get too.
